# Golang Design Patterns

Personal notes while studying Golang Design Patterns.

I thought to leave this repo public because someone might come along, read the examples here and point out that I'm an idiot and set me straight.

## SOLID
My best guess on how SOLID principles would apply to Golang which is not fully OOP in a traditional sense.

Just `go run solid/*.go`.
